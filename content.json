        "time": "6 - 7 pm",

        "abstract": "While we often hear about the benefits of Test Driven Development (TDD) and Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) and why we should follow these practices, we do not hear about HOW to actually do it.</br>In this interactive live-coding presentation we will demonstrate the mechanics of TDD using the Fizz Buzz code kata. Fizz Buzz is a childrenâ€™s game where one counts up to a given number but replaces any number divisible by three with the word \"Fizz\", and any number divisible by five with the word \"Buzz\". We will start with the acceptance criteria and implement the solution using Test Driven Development. Along the way we will use and discuss general testing concepts such as equivalence classes, boundary-value analysis, test data design, and tests as documentation. We will demonstrate how TDD drives us to solution faster by exposing and pinpointing bugs in our implementation and tests dispelling the common myth that TDD slows down development.</br>This live-coding exercise demonstrates Ruby unit testing using RSpec but applies to any language and its testing framework."
